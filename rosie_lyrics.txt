Tell me that I'm special
Tell me I look pretty
Tell me I'm a little angel
Sweetheart of your city
Say what I'm dying to hear
'Cause I'm dying to hear you
Tell me I'm that new thing
Tell me that I'm relevant
Tell me that I got a big heart
Then back it up with evidence
I need it and I don't know why
This late at night
Isn't it lonely?
I'd do anything to make you want me
I'd give it all up if you told me
That I'd be
The number one girl in your eyes
Your one and only
So what's it gon' take for you to want me
I'd give it all up if you told me
That I'd be
The number one girl in your eyes
Tell me I'm going real big places
Down to earth, so friendly
And even through all the phases
Tell me you accept me
Well, that's all I'm dying to hear
Yeah, I'm dying to hear you
Tell me that you need me
Tell me that I'm loved
Tell me that I'm worth it
And that I'm enough
I need it and I don't know why
This late at night
Isn't it lonely?
I'd do anything to make you want me
I'd give it all up if you told me
That I'd be
The number one girl in your eyes
Your one and only
So what's it gon' take for you to want me
I'd give it all up if you told me
That I'd be
The number one girl in your eyes
The girl in your eyes
The girl in your eyes
Tell me I'm the number one girl
I'm the number one girl in your eyes
The girl in your eyes
The girl in your eyes
Tell me I'm the number one girl
I'm the number one girl in your eyes
Well, isn't it lonely?
I'd do anything to make you want me
I'd give it all up if you told me
That I'd be
The number one girl in your eyes
Your one and only
So what's it gon' take for you to want me
I'd give it all up if you told me
That I'd be
The number one girl in your eyes
The number one girl in your eyes
Eh-eh, eh-eh, eh-eh
I just saw a red flag
Gonna pretend I didn't see that
'Cause is it really really that bad?
I need you really really that bad
So can we keep the story rolling
Forget that shit my mother always told me
'Cause nothing's really perfect like that
I need you really really that bad
I need you really really that bad
The one I run to
Take my makeup off and say goodnight to
The one I pretty talk and ugly cry to
The world can roll their eyes, but there's no use
I just want it to be you
When it's 3am
I'm losing myself and my mind again
The one who gives me love that is bullet proof
The world can roll their eyes, but there's no use
I just want it to be you
Eh-eh, eh-eh, eh-eh
I just want it to be you
Eh-eh, eh-eh, eh-eh
I just want it to be you
Hold me
Kiss me on my face
Talk shit about the world with me all day
And even when I'm putting you through hell
Say I'm not like anyone else
Slowly words roll off my tongue
You're everything I need and it's so dumb
And even when you're putting me through hell
You're not like anyone else
I wanna run to
Take my makeup off and say goodnight to
The one I pretty talk and ugly cry to
The world can roll their eyes, but there's no use
I just want it to be you
When it's 3am
And I'm losing myself and my mind again
The one who gives me love that is bullet proof
The world can roll their eyes, but there's no use
I just want it to be you
Eh-eh, eh-eh, eh-eh
I just want it to be you
Eh-eh, eh-eh, eh-eh
I just want it to be you
Eh-eh, eh-eh, eh-eh
I just want it to be you
Eh-eh, eh-eh, eh-eh
I just want it to be you
How'd it all fall apart
You were right here before, in my arms
Now you're invisible
But the heartbreak's physical
Got a place, moved away
Somewhere with a different code, different state
Still feels miserable
God, it's so chemical
All that I know
Is I can't let you go
It's been two years and you're still not gone
It doesn't make sense that I can't move on
Yeah, I try, I try, I try, I try
But this love never dies
Two years since you've been in my bed
Even had a funeral for you in my head
Yeah, I try, I try, I try, I try
But this love never dies
Another night, another vice
Even try with someone new, someone nice
I'll always hate the fact that you, ruined everybody after you
I'm always coming back to you
It's been two years and you're still not gone
It doesn't make sense that I can't move on
Yeah, I try, I try, I try, I try
But this love never dies
Two years since you've been in my bed
Even had a funeral for you in my head
Yeah, I try, I try, I try, I try
But this love never dies
Maybe I'm just sick and this is how it's gonna be
Maybe this is all I know
And I know it's not you, it's me
'Cause it's been two years and you're still not gone
It doesn't make sense that I can't move on
Yeah, I try, I try, I try, I try
But this love never dies
It's been two years since you've been in my bed
Even had a funeral for you in my head
Yeah, I try, I try, I try, I try
But this love never dies
Call us what we are
Toxic from the start
Can't pretend that I was in the dark
When you met my friends
Didn't even try with them
I should've known it then that you were
Jealous and possessive
So manipulating
Honestly impressive
You had me participating
Back then when I was running out of your place
I said, "I never wanna see your face"
I meant I couldn't wait to see it again
We were toxic 'til the end
Uh-huh
'Cause even when I said it was over
You heard, "Baby, can you pull me in closer?"
You were plotting how to stay in my head
We were toxic 'til the end
Ladies and gentleman
I present to you, the ex
His favorite game is chess
Who would ever guess
Playing with the pieces in my chest?
Now he's on the screen
Saying don't leave
You stole that line from me 'cause you're just
Jealous and possessive
So manipulating
Honestly impressive
You had me participating
Back then when I was running out of your place
I said, "I never wanna see your face"
I meant I couldn't wait to see it again
We were toxic 'til the end
Uh-huh
'Cause even when I said it was over
You heard, "Baby, can you pull me in closer?"
You were plotting how to stay in my head
We were toxic 'til the end
I can't forgive you for a lot of things
For not giving me back my Tiffany rings
I'll never forgive you for one thing, my dear
You wasted my prettiest years
Back then when I was running out of your place
I said, "I never wanna see your face"
I meant I couldn't wait to see it again
We were toxic
Uh-huh
'Cause even when I said it was over
You heard, "Baby, can you pull me in closer?"
You were plotting how to stay in my head
We were toxic 'til the end
End, end
We were toxic 'til the end
End, end
Standing in the corner of a crowded place
This is boring 'til I heard your name
And now I'm staying for ya
We're just friends, it's okay
Kinda weird how my night changed
Is it just me starting to see?
You in a different light
I know we can't say what we mean
But I'm happy that you're here tonight
I'm feeling so good
At a bad party
We don't have to talk
I know that you want me
Gotta keep it nice
We cannot be naughty
We can get drinks
Or we could get coffee
Feeling so good
At a bad party
We don't have to talk
I know that you want me
Gotta keep it nice
We cannot be naughty
We can get drinks
Or we could get coffee
Is it so wrong?
I've been thinking 'bout you
All day, yesterday, and today and tomorrow
Is it so wrong?
I've been bending the truth
All day, yesterday, and today and tomorrow
Is it just me starting to see?
You in a different light
I know we can't say what we mean
But you know that I mean it right
I'm feeling so good
At a bad party
We don't have to talk
I know that you want me
Gotta keep it nice
We cannot be naughty
We could get drinks
Or we could get coffee
Feeling so good
At a bad party
We don't have to talk
I know that you want me
Gotta keep it nice
We cannot be naughty
We could get drinks
Or we could get coffee
Drinks, coffee

If crying was fun, I'd be having the time of my life
If loving you was a jump, yeah, I probably died a hundred-ten times
Gave you my favorite memories
Yeah, I hate the way I let you inside
Just so you can take it for granted
Two years, now I understand it
Yeah, you'll always be a gameboy
But these days, I don't wanna play, boy
Say, say what you wanna say
You're never gonna change
You'll only ever be a heartbreak
Heartbreak
You'll only ever be a heartbreak, heartbreak
Yeah, you got a little too good actin' like a good guy
And I bought it for a minute but it isn't what you made it look like
You got a cute face and that kept me entertained
And the way you said my name, won't lie, it felt amazing
But you took my love for granted
And it took me two years to understand it
Yeah, you'll always be a gameboy
But these days, I don't wanna play, boy
Say, say what you wanna say
You're never gonna change
You'll only ever be a heartbreak
Yeah, you'll always be a gameboy
All day, kept me on the chase, boy
Say, say what you wanna say
You're never gonna change
You'll only ever be a heartbreak
Shame on me, should've known better
I let you play me, whatever
Some things just ain't meant to be
Kinda like you and me, yeah, yeah
Thought you would love me forever
I should've known you would never
Some things just ain't meant to be
Kinda like you and me, yeah, yeah
Yeah, you'll always be a gameboy

Heartbreak
You'll only ever be a heartbreak, heartbreak
Stay a little longer
Take a little longer
To pack up your bags
You're moving too fast
Make me want to hate you
So I don't have to miss you
Oh, make a mistake
So someone's to blame
I can't stand these four walls without you inside them
Build us a castle, then leave me in silence
What if I tangled some rope 'round your feet?
Into the ocean, 'cause I'm in too deep
Please won't you stay, stay a little longer, babe?
Don't walk away, when I'm here calling your name
I'm fragile
I'm speechless
Don't leave me in pieces
Already having enough trouble breathing
Please won't you stay, stay a little longer, babe?
Walk a little slower
Stand a little closer
So I can convince you
The minute I kiss you
Speak a little softer
So I don't have to answer
And make it okay
Before you can say
I can't stand these four walls without you inside them
Build us a castle, then leave me in silence
What if I tangled some rope 'round your feet?
Into the ocean, 'cause I'm in too deep
Please won't you stay, stay a little longer, babe?
I'll be okay, you say it's written all over my face
I'm fragile
I'm speechless
Don't leave me in pieces
Already having enough trouble breathing
Please won't you stay, stay a little longer, babe? Oh
Babe
Stay a little longer
Take a little longer
To pack up your bags
You're moving too fast
Make me wanna hate you
So I don't have to miss you
Oh, make a mistake
So someone's to blame
Please won't you stay, stay a little longer, babe?
I'll be okay, you say it's written all over my face
I'm fragile
I'm speechless
Don't leave me in pieces
Already having enough trouble breathing
Please won't you stay, stay a little longer, babe? Oh
Say what you want to, babe
But you know that you're talking in circles
Tell me lies like we okay
Promise 'til your face turns purple
That you're gon' love me, love me
One day you gon' love me right
Shame on me for trustin' you once, trustin' you twice
Yeah, we had only and nothin' but time
But some things just change overnight
I don't know who you think you're kiddin', babe
Yeah you're not the same, not the same
Yeah, we had good days and light on our side
But you fucked up and you know that I'm right
I don't know who you think you're kiddin', babe
Yeah, you're not the same, not the same, not the same
Pick it up, up
Drop your keys, come get your stuff, yeah
Findin' you hard to confide in
Did letting me down get tiring?
I keep on walking through all of the memories that I had with you
And I don't miss it, the way you broke my love
Yeah, we had only and nothin' but time
But some things just change overnight
I don't know who you think you're kiddin', babe
Yeah, you're not the same, not the same
Yeah, we had good days and light on our side
But you fucked up and you know that I'm right
I don't know who you think you're kiddin', babe
Oh, you're not the same, not the same, not the same
Oh, what a shame, nothing's the same
All of my love, you put it to waste
And you can keep pointing the finger
Thought it'd be us, go figure
We had only and nothin' but time
But some things just change overnight
I don't know who you think you're kiddin', babe
Yeah, you're not the same, not the same
Oh, we had good days and light on our side
But you fucked up and you know that I'm right
I don't know who you think you're kiddin', babe
Oh, you're not the same, not the same, not the same
We're at a crossroad
And we don't know which way to go
Part of me lost hope
And part of me just can't let go
We said we'd cross those bridges when they came
Now it's time to give it a name
Yeah, we're at a crossroad
So, baby, let me know
Do I call you my ex or do I call you my boyfriend?
Call you a lover, do I call you a friend?
Call you the one or the one that got away?
Someone I'll just have to forget
Do I call you every night you're gone or never call you again?
Do we have a future or should I call it the end?
We were a moment
And you were my only true oasis
Now all those oceans
Are falling down our faces
So if we don't see it through
I'm a better me because of you
Yeah, we're at a crossroad
So, baby, let me know
Do I call you my ex or do I call you my boyfriend?
Call you a lover, do I call you a friend?
Call you the one or the one that got away?
Someone I'll just have to forget
Do I call you every night you're gone or never call you again?
Do we have a future or should I call it the end?
Should I call it the end?
Are we lovers or friends?
It's as good as it gets?
Should I call it the end?
And it crept up on us
In the way that it does
And the moment disappeared
In the desert of us, all our tears turned to dust
Now the roses don't grow here
I guess that love does what it wants
And that's just too bad for us
Was it all just slight of hand?
Another trick that fate has played on us again
Two heads in the sand
I hear you talkin' but I just can't understand
Caught in no man's land between the wires
Comin' under friendly fire
Can't go forward, can't go back again
And it crept up on us, in the way that it does
And the moment disappeared
In the desert of us
All our tears turned to dust
Now the roses don't grow here
I guess that love does what it wants
And that's just too bad for us
Flying high with both eyes closed
Almost touched the sun I guess we got too close
Now I'm dancing on my own
But the music's not as good when you're alone
Caught in no man's land between the wires
Comin' under friendly fire
Can't go forward, can't go back again
And it crept up on us, in the way that it does
And the moment disappeared
In the desert of us
All our tears turned to dust
Now the roses don't grow here
I guess that love does what it wants
And that's just too bad for us
We wanna talk but we don't wanna listen
We play pretend but we both know it's missin'
If love burns too bright it burns out in a minute
At least that's what I tell myself
We wanna talk but we don't wanna listen
We play pretend but we both know it's missin'
If love burns too bright it burns out in a minute
At least that's what I tell myself
And it crept up on us
In the way that it does
And the moment disappeared
In the desert of us
All our tears turned to dust
Now the roses don't grow here
I guess that love does what it wants
And that's just too bad for us
Got out of my bed today
The sunlight was hitting my face
And two little birds came and sat on the edge
And they asked if I'm doin' okay
And we talked for a while, sat for a while
And one of them asked me if there's anything I would change
And I didn't know what to say
But I, I would dance all night
Not care about the heartache in my life
Oh, and I would not obsess
Over all the little things I don't regret
I'd dance all night
Ni-i-ight
I'd dance all night
Ni-i-ight
Oh, and I-I-I
I'd dance all night
Ni-i-ight
Dance all night
I wouldn't be so in my head
Three words every chance that I gеt
Be spontaneous and bettеr with trust
And say things that I should've said
I would let my feelings lead me
Let you be the one to hold me now
And maybe this time you could stay
'Cause I, I would dance all night
Not care about the heartache in my life
Oh, and I would not obsess
Over all the little things I don't regret
I'd dance all night
Ni-i-ight
I'd dance all night
Ni-i-ight
Oh, and I-I-I
I'd dance all night
Ni-i-ight
Dance all night, I'll be there for you tomorrow
You can dry your eyes, we'll laugh away the sorrow
When the morning comes, just promise me you'll stay forever young
Forever young
I, I would dance all night
Not care about the heartache in my life
Oh, and I would not obsess
Over all the little things I don't regret
I'd dance all night
Ni-i-ight
I'd dance all night
Ni-i-ight
Oh, and I-I-I
I'd dance all night
Ni-i-ight
Dance all night
